<li>It's tempting to think that "bias" refers to the feature selection process.  It does not.</li>
<li>Bias is how bad your model $E(T)$ is at predicting the true value of a parameter $\theta$.  (i.e. $E(T)=\theta+bias(\theta)$, and if $bias(\theta)=0$, then $E(T)=\theta$ -- you have an unbiased model)</li>
<li>Sometimes having bias is good.  In machine learning, having a little bias can significantly reduce variance.</li>

<li>You have a procedure to generate models.  This procedure builds simple models with few features.</li>
<li>You chose those few features.  Why not other features?  (it's tempting to think this is "bias", but it's not.  Bias how bad your model is at predicting the actual value -- i.e.)</li>
<li>Since there are few features, changes to the dataset will have limited effects on the parameters of the model -- different models built using this procedure will look similar (low variance)</li>
<li>Your model may not have enough parameters to learn the real underlying relationships (high bias, underfitting)</li>

<li>This represents most machine learning models today.</li>
<li>You have a procedure to generate models.  This procedure builds complex models with many features.</li>
<li>You did not choose any features.  Just throw everything in (low bias)</li>
<li>Since there are many features, changes to the dataset can have large effects on the parameters of the model -- different models built using this procedure may look very different (high variance)</li>
<li>Your model may also learn noise that only exists in the training data, but not the real world (overfitting)</li>
