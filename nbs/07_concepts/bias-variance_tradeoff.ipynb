    "- Bias is how bad your model $E(T)$ is at predicting the true value of a parameter $\\theta$.  (i.e. $E(T)=\\theta+bias(\\theta)$, and if $bias(\\theta)=0$, then $E(T)=\\theta$ -- you have an unbiased model)\n",

    "- Since there are few features, changes to the dataset will have limited effects on the parameters of the model -- different models built using this procedure will look similar (low variance)\n",
